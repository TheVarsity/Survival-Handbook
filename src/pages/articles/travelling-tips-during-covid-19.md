For university students who study away from home or need to travel during the year, flying has been made particularly difficult due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since travel may be necessary for some this year, it’s important to take a look at COVID-19 safety tips when travelling to Toronto. Before flying, weigh your personal needs and keep your surrounding population at reduced risk of COVID-19.

I recently flew home to British Columbia for family reasons and can attest to the decision-making process and the travel experience. Traveller volume is lower, and regulatory changes have made airports feel strange, but safer.

From my experience, I gathered some travel tips to ease your feelings of uncertainty, discomfort, and stress.

* Before you travel, check your destination’s regulations on self-quarantine.
* Security and boarding procedures have increased regulations. Contact your airline or airlines with any questions you may have.
* Transport Canada mandates that masks be worn through security, during boarding, on flights, and during offloading. These are for situations in which physical distancing from security agents, airline staff, and fellow passengers is not possible.
* Before donning your mask in these situations, wash or disinfect your hands. Consistent hand hygiene is important for effective mask usage.
* Be prepared to respond to a few extra questions during boarding. These mainly pertain to your state of health, previous travel, and related topics. There are also some checkpoints that take your temperature before you’re allowed to pass.
* Once at your gate, it is easy to distance yourself from other travellers. Many airports have blocked off seats to ensure distancing.
* Flight staff have reduced onboard food and beverage services in order to reduce contact with passengers. Plan ahead by bringing a meal or snacks, and if you’re travelling internationally, look into the foods that cannot cross borders.
* When I travelled, many food outlets were closed, and water fountains were shut off. Even if you dislike single-use plastics, your best bet for hydration is to purchase a bottled beverage after security.

Some challenges may arise upon your arrival. A time zone change means waking up earlier or later for online courses. Make sure you adjust your sleeping habits in a healthy manner. On top of this, if you are arriving to U of T from outside of Canada, you will also require a 14-day self-quarantine.

U of T is providing its students who are arriving from international locations with quarantine accommodations under its Mandatory Quarantine Accommodation program, which began on August 15.

This is available by filling out [an application](http://starrez.utoronto.ca) using your JOIN/UTORid at least seven days before travelling to U of T. Students returning to Toronto before this date should [contact U of T](mailto:info.quarantine@utoronto.ca) to communicate their situations.

Since the government recommends that you take a private method of transportation to your residence, U of T’s accommodations will provide transportation from the airport to the quarantine location. This program will also give students a private room with a washroom at a hotel or a U of T residence, depending on the availability of the facilities.

Since you cannot leave your residence during those two weeks, you should also plan ahead to get groceries. U of T’s accommodations provide three meals a day, delivered to your door, and other quarantine supplies and services including daily check-ins or nurse monitoring.

If you find yourself unable to access U of T’s program for any reason, some other suggestions include taking an Uber as a private method of transportation to your quarantine residence. Also, you can have a roommate or friend already in Canada stock up groceries beforehand in your home or get groceries delivered to you. There are also options for meal kit delivery programs like Goodfood — which has a discount for first-time members — and HelloFresh, or grocery delivery services.

In general, try your best to avoid vulnerable populations, public spaces, and transit. Wear a mask and gloves while practicing physical distancing.

Looking to the near future, universities are making decisions about what learning will look like. If current trends continue, air travel may become overwhelmed as September approaches, so give yourself enough time to move and plan accordingly. Make use of your support system of classmates, friends, and university staff in Toronto by asking them to help you arrange a move on their end.

As always, stay safe, stay connected, and prioritize your own health and the health of those around you.
