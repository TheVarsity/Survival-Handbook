So, the new school year is upon us. Gone are the Netflix-induced all-nighters, Zoom hangouts, and, if you’re lucky, physically distant beachy days. Now’s the time for essays, assignments, and readings.

So when you’re dragging on through seemingly endless readings and assignments, you’ll want to turn in the best work you can. Professors and teaching assistants often include grammar on marking rubrics, and knowing your grammar will reflect better on you as a student.

If you have a couple of minutes before your next deadline, there are a lot of proofreading programs that are worth your time. To test these programs, I took a sample text — part repurposed essay, part nonsense — loaded it up with grammatical errors, and ran it through three grammar-checking and proofreading programs.

Whether you struggle with passive voice, comma splices, or don’t know what the hell an em dash is, here’s how they rank.

**Grammarly**

I was really excited to try out [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) — I see ads for it everywhere and love their grammar blog. However, I felt a bit let down, and I ultimately rank this program in last place.

Overall, it was okay. It made a lot of the basic edits that word processors do, but it didn’t catch them all — such as an ‘its’ that should’ve been an ‘it’s.’ There was also a change that made the sentence more awkward than it was at the start, but as long as you’re reading your work again afterward, you should be fine.

Grammarly’s premium version offers a lot more features than the free plan, such as fluency, readability, word choice, and more. If you’re able to support the software, a premium plan is 29.95 USD a month or 139.95 USD for a year. For the extra features, it might be worth a try — if not, there are other free programs that have similar functions.

**LanguageTool**

Coming in second place is [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/). This caught almost all of the small grammatical mistakes and typos I put into it, and it also picked up on smaller grammar mistakes like unhyphenated compound modifiers.

As an em dash enthusiast, I was also delighted to see that it was the only program to pick up on the fact that I’d typed hyphens instead of actual em dashes. If you don’t know, those beautiful — interruptive — dashes that distract you mid-sentence are called em dashes and have their own keystroke.

That being said, LanguageTool didn’t have any larger edits like those for stronger word choice, readability, or passive voice. LanguageTool’s free version can check 20,000 characters — roughly more than 3,200 words — and a premium plan costs $6.58 per month or $79 a year.

**ProWritingAid**

I’d never heard of [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/) before, but I was really impressed — this one is definitely my top pick. It caught almost all of the small errors I had deliberately put into the text and also made a lot of great suggestions beyond those.

It picked up on a lot of things that the other programs didn’t — such as that I’d taken out an opening double quotation mark, misspelled an author’s name, and used passive voice. Passive verbs can really lag down your writing — especially if you’re writing an essay — so this is definitely a plus.

ProWritingAid has several functions you can run to assess your work for readability, consistency, diction, and structure, catching things like dangling prepositions, inconsistent spellings and hyphenations, and where your spelling is leaning American or British.

The free online version allows you to check 500 words at a time; if you can afford to support the software, a premium subscription is 20 USD per month or 79 USD per year.

One thing that none of the programs picked up were comma splices — although ProWritingAid did have a comma splice edit as an example on its website. Semicolons are your friend! Know what a comma can and cannot do and where a semicolon fits into the picture.

At the end of the day, nothing is perfect, and nothing can beat another set of eyes and opinions. But if you only have a couple of minutes before your next deadline, give one of these programs a shot!
