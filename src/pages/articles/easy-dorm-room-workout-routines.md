Given the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for safe, physically-distanced workouts so that your health and fitness goals remain within reach.

To this end, The Varsity spoke with Sara Segat, a personal trainer and certified strength and conditioning specialist who previously worked in U of T’s Sport & Recreation under the Faculty of Kinesiology & Physical Education and came up with three quick exercise routines to help you stay healthy and active from your dorm rooms.

Turn up your best workout playlist and get ready to sweat with these 15–20 minute series!

**Workout one: working with a timer**

Equipment needed: none!

How-to: do as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of the following series. Try to take short breaks between rounds.

* 10 mountain climbers: get into plank position and drive your knees toward your elbows. Both legs ‘climbing’ once counts as one repetition.

* 15 glute bridges: on your back, drive your hips forward so that you’re holding your butt in the air while squeezing your glutes. Go up and down.

* 20 air squats: go deeper than a regular squat! Make sure your hips go lower than your knees.

“You can set a timer and say, ‘Okay, I want to see how many squats I can get in 30-second bursts,’ and that’s really going to pump up your intensity,” Segat said.

She added that “having something that is very measurable is also a really great way to stay on top of your own fitness.” Try to track your progress and see if you can get more rounds done in the 20 minute time span each time you try this workout!

**Workout two: working with a goal, volume one**

Equipment needed: a backpack, textbooks, and a skipping rope.

How-to: try five to six rounds of the following series of exercises for a 10–15 minute workout. If this feels too easy or too difficult, you can change the number of rounds accordingly.

* Skip rope for one minute. If you don’t have a rope, you can do jumping jacks or high knees.

* 20 walking lunges. Pro tip: wear a backpack filled with textbooks for resistance!

“Give yourself a goal,” Segat said. “Say, ‘I want to get 100 pushups done today.’ That will hold you accountable.”

**Workout three: working with a goal, volume two**

**Equipment needed**: a chair and a skipping rope.

**How-to**: try five rounds of the following series of exercises for 20 minutes. Again, you can adapt the number of rounds depending on the level of difficulty.

* Skip rope for one minute. Remember, you can do jumping jacks or high knees if you don’t have a rope.

* 20 step-ups on a chair. You can choose to alternate between legs or do 10 reps on one leg and then switch to the other to increase intensity.

* 20 side lunges.

* 10 tricep dips on a chair: stand in front of your chair and place your hands on either side of the seat. Lower yourself down as if you were to sit down in the space in front of the chair — not on it — and push yourself up again with your arms.

Remember to finish your workouts with a full-body stretch and drink water to stay hydrated. Happy training!
