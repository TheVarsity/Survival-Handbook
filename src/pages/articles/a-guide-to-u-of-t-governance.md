Who controls my tuition? Who is Meric Gertler? What does my college do, exactly? Where should I go if I need help with course selection? As an incoming student, knowing the answers to these questions will inevitably come in handy at some point in time.

With an undergraduate population of over 72,000 and a graduate population of over 20,000 students spread across three campuses, U of T is large, complex, and decentralized. Understanding how it works can be an asset in many ways — from getting involved in student governance to knowing who to reach out to if you don’t like the way university works.

U of T’s highest governing body is the Governing Council overseen by President Meric Gertler, who is responsible for directing the university along with its senior administrators.

The rest of the Governing Council consists of the chancellor, as well as student, staff, and faculty representatives. They hold meetings in the Simcoe Hall Council Chamber; throughout the year, groups of students often advocate outside Simcoe Hall on a variety of issues, such as mental health policy and divestment from fossil fuels.

After Gertler, the next highest-ranked person in U of T’s governance is Vice-President and Provost Cheryl Regehr, who is the senior assessor on the Academic Board and who oversees academic and budgetary matters with a host of vice-provosts under her.

Another important person to know is Vice-Provost Students Sandy Welsh, who is the senior assessor on the University Affairs Board and oversees anything concerning student life — a broad category that includes student services such as Accessibility Services, the Health & Wellness Centre, and Housing Services, among others.

There are lots of different boards and committees that meet to pass motions before they go to the main Governing Council, such as the Academic Board, Business Board, and University Affairs Board, along with the UTM and UTSC campus councils.

As for U of T’s tri-campus structure, that’s just one more confusing part: though all campuses give out the same U of T degree, the satellite campuses often have different programs and policies. The top officials at the satellite campuses are the vice-president and principal — Alexandra Gillespie at UTM and Wisdom Tettey at UTSC.

Next, onto student governance. There are three big unions that represent undergraduate students, one at each campus. UTSG has the University of Toronto Students’ Union (UTSU), UTM has the University of Toronto Mississauga Students’ Union, and UTSC has the Scarborough Campus Students’ Union. The University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union (UTGSU), meanwhile, represents the graduate students on all three campuses. The executives of these unions are elected before the end of each school year.

Their roles are twofold: services and advocacy. The student unions hold events and meetings, and they offer services such as health and dental coverage. They also lobby the administration and local government to support different causes. Students pay a levy, a fee collected by the university, to the unions each semester in exchange for membership.

All students are part of a faculty whether they are studying engineering, commerce, or music. The largest faculty is the Faculty of Arts & Science (FAS). One of the biggest student unions, besides the UTSU, is the Arts and Science Students’ Union, and most departments have their own course unions as well.

Since it’s so large, students in the FAS are placed in seven different colleges. Among these, Victoria College, Trinity College, and St. Michael’s College are federated colleges, meaning that they operate semi-autonomously from the central administration. New College, Woodsworth College, Innis College, and University College are the constituent colleges.

Though people sometimes say that your college doesn’t matter after first year, it still has functions beyond residence and orientation. For most students, their college registrar’s office will be the place to go for questions surrounding course selection, financial matters, and advising. Some colleges offer scholarships specific to their students. You also pay fees to your college’s student government, which you are automatically a part of.

There you have it — a general sketch of U of T’s governance structure. From the administration to the student executives, each role has a specific impact in shaping your experience at U of T.
