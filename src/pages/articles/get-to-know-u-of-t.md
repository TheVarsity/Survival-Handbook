Content warning: this article contains mentions of suicide.

Congratulations! You are at U of T. Now that you’re in, your time at U of T poses itself to be the best years of your life — or the most challenging.

While you are bound to enjoy the unparallelled beauty of a university experience in a thriving city like Toronto, you must also face the reality that anti-Black racism, the mental health crisis, and sexual violence pose serious obstacles for students on campus.

All hope is not lost, however — students are fighting back, and you can, too.

**Anti-Black racism**

With U of T’s exclusive prestige comes exclusion, and this is something that incoming first-years may be painfully aware of, particularly if they are Black. In recent memory, there have been a number of public incidents of anti-Black racism, whether at the Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering or at Massey College.

Looking back at my own experiences as a Trinity College student living on campus — a member of a Black populous that you can count on one hand — the imposter syndrome can be hard to battle, but remember, you’re here because you deserve to be.

To incoming students, the challenge then is to find your community on campus, to avoid complacency, call out oppression and discrimination, and, when responses are given, to discern the empty promises lazily thrown out for temporary placation.

Student groups like the Black Students’ Association have been at the forefront of Black resistance on campus. In the current post-George Floyd moment, Black students at the Trinity Anti-Racism Collective are holding the institution accountable for its history of racism and marginalization.

By getting involved and supporting such communities, or even programs like equity studies, we have a wealth of opportunities to learn more about important social issues and directly facilitate social change on and off of campus.

**The mental health crisis**

U of T has been shaken by multiple student deaths by suicide since 2018, including one just last September. Since then, student activism has challenged the university to invest more in mental health resources and support.

Following the creation of a mental health task force, U of T has since rolled out measures such as the My Student Support Program app for confidential counselling; a list of contacts for different types of distress, including resources within and outside of the university; and a partnership with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Student demands call for more to be done, but this is certainly a step-up from therapy dogs in the libraries.

As incoming students, one thing you have to be prepared for is the casual — and even encouraged — discussion and comparison of stress levels, sleeplessness, and misery amongst students.

But bad mental health is not a competition, and the amount of stress one is under is not indicative of how hard they are working. Among behaviours in U of T culture, this continues to be the most harmful and toxic.

With COVID-19, addressing mental health is more important than ever. Look into the health plan that your student union offers to get help, and also consider getting involved in mental health clubs like the UofT Mental Health Policy Council and U of Thrive to join the fight for better mental health on campus.

**Sexual violence — and misogyny in general**

Another issue that is prevalent at U of T is sexual violence, which is disproportionately experienced by women. Silence is Violence, a student advocacy group at the university, published a study in 2019 that found that out of 544 respondents, around 20 per cent experienced some form of sexual violence.

With some students reporting gaps in U of T’s sexual violence support system, this is a major issue that needs to be addressed holistically.

There is of course the broader challenge of misogyny on campus. Yet, this is often met with little to no penalty. For instance, while David Gilmour, a professor at Victoria College, made comments about only wanting to include books by “serious heterosexual guys” in his syllabi back in 2013, Victoria College still offers his courses.

This is just one example that points to a willingness to underplay and ignore misogyny in the name of academic prestige, a toxic tradition that limits the reach of women in academia.

In STEM fields in particular, you are also bound to hear from women in men-dominated courses that they feel excluded or undermined in their studies.

The good news: more women are enrolling in programs in STEM fields, which is a good sign that the antiquated notions are changing about academia and which careers are best suited for men or women. Student organizations such as Women in Science and Engineering make this easier by promoting an inclusive environment for women in STEM fields and supporting them through networking, even after graduation.
