*Content warning: this article contains mentions of suicide.*

Congratulations! You are at U of T. Now that you’re in, your time at U of T poses itself to be the best years of your life — or the worst. With anti-Black racism, elitism, and the rampant mental health crisis all present on campus, how do you balance the unparalleled beauty of a university experience in a thriving urban city and the ugliness behind its walls?

**Elitism and racism**

With U of T’s exclusiveness comes exclusion, and this is something that incoming first-years may be painfully aware of, particularly if they are Black.

Looking back at my own experiences as a Trinity College student living on campus — a member of a Black populous that you can count on one hand — the imposter syndrome can be hard to battle, but remember, you’re here because you deserve to be. To incoming students, the challenge then is to find your community on campus, to avoid complacency, call out oppression and discrimination, and, when responses are given, to discern the empty promises lazily thrown out for temporary placation.

**The mental health crisis**

While much has been done to address the rampant mental health crisis on campus — certainly a step-up from therapy dogs in the libraries — my first year on campus was punctuated by students appealing for help in the wake of a tragic campus suicide. As incoming students, one thing you have to be prepared for is the casual — and even encouraged — discussion and comparison of stress levels, sleeplessness, and misery amongst students.

But bad mental health is not a competition, and the amount of stress one is under is not indicative of how hard they are working. Among U of T’s traditions and student behaviours, this continues to be the most harmful and toxic.

**Getting involved — big, small, and off campus**

Academics likely brought you here, but part of the holistic university experience is involvement in causes, clubs, and events on campus that foster a unique satisfaction not quite matched by the neuroses of GPA maintenance.

As a U of T student, you have a wealth of opportunities to help you achieve this satisfaction — colleges, forums, and Facebook groups all advertise opportunities to “get involved!” But this can be small and personal. One thing to love about U of T is that it is the perfect platform for Socratic discussions to challenge your personal paradigms. However, don’t be afraid to leave campus — especially now, with the majority of classes being online — and enjoy the urban city around you.

To sum up, the best advice I can possibly give you is that you must be diligent at U of T. Not just in your studies, but in every aspect of your life, in defence of your morals, in the upkeep of your mental health, in making connections, and so forth. Hopefully this guide makes it a bit easier for you to prepare for what’s to come.
