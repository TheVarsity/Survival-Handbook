From participating in orientation week from your bedroom to getting to know your ECO101 — Principles of Microeconomics teaching assistant (TA) through Zoom, making connections is going to look a little different for our incoming first-years. And while the class of 2024 is going to experience a far-from-conventional first year, all hope is not lost!

In an era where many of our interactions already take place via screens, an obvious answer to the question of how to make connections this year is using social media. The Instagram account @uoft2024 is a good platform to use as you start interacting with other first-years.

As new blues introduce themselves with a photo and caption, look out for anyone with whom to strike up a conversation, even if it’s just because you both love Avatar: The Last Airbender. By commenting on their post or shooting them an awkward direct message, you have yourself the start of a friendship that is truly a ‘sign of the times.ʼ

You should also check out the official U of T Class of 2024 Facebook group or, better yet, your college-specific Facebook group. By doing this, you will not only uncover a network of active course-specific and program-specific group chats, but you will also see that many clubs are recruiting.

Connecting with people through clubs is a safe bet because you’ll meet like-minded people and continually interact with them throughout the year, regardless of whether meetings are held online or not.

However, making connections in your first year extends beyond your classmates. Getting to know your TAs and professors will clearly be affected by the digitization of this academic year.

However, despite being at home, you should dress casually and keep your video on for online classes. Doing so will make your classes much more engaging and encourage you to participate more often.

Then, later on, when emailing your TA questions or attending online office hours with your professor, your presence in the class will already be established, and you’ll be able to further develop that connection. Trust me, professors and TAs notice the students who show up consistently and look engaged.

Still, making connections in your first year can be daunting, and the added virtual element may, understandably, make some students squirm. If this is the case for you, you should start small.

Laidback virtual hangouts such as “Board Game Cafe Thursdays” and “All Write Together” can be found on the Hart House website. These events might be a good place for you to ease yourself into forming meaningful relationships because they are safe spaces for you to connect with a small group of people.

Additionally, if you feel overwhelmed, U of T Student Life organizes many low-interaction online events that encourage students to practice self-care, such as online meditation or balanced living workshops.

As U of T prepares to digitally welcome you, keep in mind that every first-year is in the same position as you. Everyone is eager to settle in during this anomalous year. And while we wish that we could have welcomed you to campus another way, know that you have a place in the U of T community, and that is an unfailing truth — independent of time zones, online classes, and distance.
