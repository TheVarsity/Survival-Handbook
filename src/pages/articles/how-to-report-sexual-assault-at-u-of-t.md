It is commonly known that one of the most prevalent issues among postsecondary institutions is sexual violence.

According to CBC News, a province-wide survey conducted last year indicated that [approximately 63 per cent of postsecondary students in Ontario have experienced sexual harassment on campus.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-campus-sexual-assault-1.5062892) Moreover, UTSG has also reported [an increase from one to 10 reported sexual assault cases within a year](https://thevarsity.ca/2020/07/17/2019-campus-police-reports-show-increase-in-reported-sexual-assault-at-utsg/). Furthermore, the majority of incidents remain unreported.

For those who have experienced sexual violence, know that you are not alone. There are multiple services that the U of T community provides on campus to address the situation. There are also staff and counsellors available to listen to and resonate with your experience.

However, know that you are not obligated to disclose your experiences with university officials or take official actions against your abuser. The processes and resources in this article are meant to inform you of your options if you wish to take them.

**Defining sexual violence**

In order to raise awareness and understanding of sexual violence, we can first break down the term.

[The University of Toronto’s Policy on Sexual Violence and Harassment](https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/Student-SV-Policy-Companion-Guide-Jan2019.pdf) defines sexual violence as “any sexual act or act targeting a person’s sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression.” The incident can be physical or psychological in nature. Some examples include sexual assault, indecent exposure, and sexual exploitation.

Sexual violence is not only limited to one form, as the term encompasses a range of physical, verbal, virtual, and visual acts. Ultimately, the defining feature among all sexual violence incidents is the absence of consent.

**Option one: disclosure**

After experiencing an incident of sexual violence, you have two routes available to you from U of T or the police: [disclosure or reporting](https://www.svpscentre.utoronto.ca/support/disclose-or-report/).

The process of [disclosing](https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/Student-SV-Policy-Companion-Guide-Jan2019.pdf) is essentially similar to informing a close friend about the situation. Some examples of a disclosure include booking an appointment to speak to a counsellor or informing an instructor, as speaking about the situation may help people cope with their trauma and emotions.

The disclosure method does not formally launch an investigation and the perpetrator does not need to be a member of the U of T community. The U of T community member in whom you confide may consult with U of T’s Sexual Violence Prevention & Support Centre (SVPSC) for advice, but they cannot divulge specific information without permission.

**Option two: reporting to U of T**

The reporting process can follow a disclosure or the incident of sexual violence itself. Under U of T’s policy, in the case of an emergency, the SVPSC will contact the Campus Police, who will in turn give the SVPSC and the municipal police details about the incident. Reports can also be filed at a later date.

There are two avenues for [reporting](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/sexual-violence-and-sexual-harassment-policy-december-12-2019), as you can choose to either report to U of T or to campus or municipal police.

If you choose to report to U of T, know that the jurisdiction of U of T only includes incidents of sexual violence that involve a U of T community member. Furthermore, reporting only to U of T will not bring criminal action or investigation against the perpetrator, only action within U of T’s jurisdiction.

To take this route, you will report the incident to the SVPSC. The report contains specific details about the situation, such as the place, time, and people involved. When the SVPSC receives the report, a comprehensive evaluation and investigation process will be made to determine the appropriate actions.

After the SVPSC reviews the documents, it will forward the report to the Office of Safety and High Risk. Upon discussion and policy consideration, the office may initiate an independent internal investigation or an alternative resolution. Potential consequences for the perpetrator include suspension, expulsion, or other penalties. The SVPSC also has the right to alter the class and work schedules of those involved in the report.

If you wish to cease the reporting process, you should inform the SVPSC or Office of Safety and High Risk before the investigation. This is because when the investigation begins, the office will contact the perpetrator, and it will be difficult to stop the assessment after that point.

Throughout the reporting process, confidentiality and integrity are expected by the SVPSC and other individuals involved in the situation. Before the investigation begins, confidentiality expectations should be outlined and communicated to you with clarity.

It should be noted that, in certain cases, if you request U of T not to investigate or act on your disclosure or report, U of T will consider that request. Nonetheless, U of T may decide to proceed if it decides that the incident or perpetrator poses a danger to the health and safety of the members of the U of T community. However, this is not very common, and you have a right to not participate in the investigation.

The SVPSC also upholds standards of confidentiality by following the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. Information will only be shared when required by law or for future policy implementation. For example, when sexual violence against a minor occurs or the individuals involved are in serious risk of harming themselves, it will then be mandatory for the SVPSC to share personal information.

**Option three: reporting to police**

You can also take another route by reporting the incident to Campus Police, or municipal police if the incident was perpetrated by somebody who is not a member of the U of T community. This report is separate from one made to U of T at the SVPSC, and it may trigger a police investigation and criminal proceedings.

If Campus Police receives a report, it will share the report with SVPSC, and, according to UTSC Campus Police’s website, officers consult with municipal police when dealing with reports.

When filing a report with municipal police, you will be given the option to have a sexual assault evidence kit performed at a sexual assault and domestic violence care centre to collect forensic evidence of the assault. You can also go directly to a sexual violence centre and have one performed, which will not automatically begin a formal report, but rather, it will collect evidence that can be helpful if you choose to initiate one.

Know that this evidence is best collected if it is within 72 hours after the incident, you have not changed your clothes, and you have not taken a shower or bathed. However, evidence is still possible to collect even if you have completed one of those actions or more than 72 hours have passed.

You can choose to report to the SVPSC, the police, both, or neither at all. The decision is yours. Regardless, know that U of T has resources you can access after experiencing an incident of sexual violence.

**Resources available at U of T**

Plenty of services are available for people who have experienced sexual violence on or off campus. You can contact Campus Police at 416-978-2222 at UTSG and UTSC, or 905-569-4333 at UTM. [The SVPSC](https://www.svpscentre.utoronto.ca/) is not only home to disclosures and reports, but it also connects people with other services on campus. For those who need counselling, medical services, or short-term academic accommodations, staff at the SVPSC can provide a referral.

Due to the pandemic, most services are currently being provided by phone. To reserve a time slot, email [svpscentre@utoronto.ca](mailto:svpscentre@utoronto.ca) or call 416-978-2266. The centre is open from Monday to Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.

When campuses reopen for the fall semester, you can visit one of its locations listed below:

**UTSG**: Gerstein Science Information Centre, 9 King’s College Circle, Suite B139

**UTSC**: Environmental Science & Chemistry Building, 1065 Military Trail, Room 141

**UTM**: William G. Davis Building, 1867 1C6, Inner Circle Road, Room 3094G

**Off-campus resources**

There are also off-campus resources available to you. Even if you’re not aware of any injuries, you should seek medical care at a sexual assault and domestic violence care centre.

These centres can also gather forensic evidence of the sexual assault to help keep your options open further down the road.

**UTSG**: Women’s College Hospital, 76 Grenville Street, Acute Ambulatory Care Unit, Room 1256

416-323-6040

**UTM**: Trillium Health Centre, 100 Queensway West, Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Services

905-848-7493

**UTSC**: Scarborough Health Network Birchmount Hospital, 3030 Birchmount Road, Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence Care Centre, third floor

416-495-2555

**Educational resources**

For those who want to learn more about identifying sexual violence and prevention, the university has created an online training module. You can access the 40-minute interactive lesson [here](https://www.svpscentre.utoronto.ca/learn/training/).

**Promote consent culture**

Practicing consent culture is important for minimizing the amount of sexual violence incidents on and off campus. Ensuring consent relies on being comprehensive, understanding, and respectful of different limitations of sexual behaviour.

Members of U of T’s community can create a consent culture by agreeing to address the comfort of their own limitations and to look out for one another. If a survivor wishes to disclose their experience of sexual violence to you, empathize with them, and be sure to inform them about the services provided at the SVPSC.

By being on the lookout for others, we can contribute to a safer and healthier environment for future incoming and returning members of the U of T community.
