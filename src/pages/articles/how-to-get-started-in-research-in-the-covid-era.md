An unprecedented pandemic shouldn’t stop you from making the most of your experience at U of T. If you’re looking to get involved in research as a first-year and don’t know where to start, we’ve got you covered.

**Connecting while physical distancing**

While you might not be physically present during lectures and labs, it’s still important to forge important connections. Make time to attend online office hours, workshops, and research seminars and panels.

Truly engage yourself in this virtual world — ask your professors questions about their research, have conversations with your teaching assistants, and talk to graduate students and seniors. You’ll learn more about the process and variety of research. You’ll also learn more about yourself and what excites — or bores — you.

**Planning in the face of uncertainty**

While U of T has a diverse body of research, it can be difficult to know what exactly interests you. Sit down and reflect on your strengths and interests. Make no assumptions and be honest with yourself. Remember, reading about a hot research topic in the media is very different from conducting research on it.

Narrow down areas that interest you, then find faculty members researching those subjects. Read their previous publications to get a better understanding of the work they do. Then, write down skills you have, like coding in R, wet-lab techniques, et cetera.

Finally, make a list of faculty who you want to reach out to based on fit. You can reach out to faculty at any of the three campuses at U of T!

**How to cold email**

Faculty members receive tons of unsolicited emails every day asking for research opportunities, so you have to make yours stand out. This is where all your planning comes in handy. Show that you’ve done your research. Connect your interests and skills to their research areas and work. Create a tailored email pitching yourself as an asset to their team and send it to them.

Then send more — but don’t spam the entire department. You might meet pitch silence, and that can be disheartening at times, but keep at it and be genuine about your intentions. Continue to engage in your courses, with your professors, and the research community at U of T in general, and soon enough, a lead will pop up.

**Have open conversations**

If you get a response, congratulations! That’s a big deal. The principal investigator may ask to interview you. While they are interviewing you, you should also interview them in turn. Have honest conversations about accessibility, whatever that looks like for you. What are the technical requirements to working in their lab? Will you have to physically come into the lab? What do the safety precautions look like?

It is also important to clarify what your role means — are you collecting or analyzing data? What training will they provide? Is there a possibility of publishing? Asking questions will help you prepare and make the most out of your experience.

**Where do I start?**

Here are some resources to help you get started.

* The Career & Co-Curricular Learning Network: you can find advertised positions here, including volunteer, paid, and work-study opportunities.
* First Year Foundations, the One Programs, and seminar classes: capped at 25 students or fewer, small classes promote analytical thinking, group discussions, and academic engagement.
* Summer research opportunities: these are ideal for pre-med students since you can [partner with hospitals](https://glse.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-research-opportunities) like SickKids and Baycrest Health Sciences.
* The Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program: find a list of professors accepting students [here](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/academics/research-opportunities/research-opportunities-program).
