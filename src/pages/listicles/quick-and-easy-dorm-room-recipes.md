First year’s starting, and it’s probably the first time for many of you to strike out on your own. Cooking for yourself is one of the largest differences for many university students. We’ve compiled some simple recipes that you can easily make in your dorm room with minimal supplies and experience; we hope you enjoy them! 

## The fastest recipes you can make on the go

**By Kate Haberl**

It doesn’t get much simpler than this! I will note that all of these ingredients are readily available at any grocery store. If you have a meal plan, you might be able to swap some ingredients out for what they give you as take-out. And if you’re a commuter, just take them from your parents!

### The ultimate loaded grilled cheese

You can find all of these ingredients in your local grocery store — I took from my dining hall, which always had shredded mozzarella, cheddar, and feta cheese. I didn’t use feta in this recipe, but feel free to do so if that’s your vibe. 

I also used bacon or sausage from breakfast, so you could add either of those or even chicken. You can also try tomato slices or other types of vegetables to give your loaded grilled cheese a healthier and tasty kick. All you need to make this recipe is a frying pan!

Ingredients

* 2 slices of bread
* Cheese, either shredded or sliced
* Protein like bacon, chicken strips, sausage, or tofu
* Additional add-ons like tomato slices, pesto, garlic, spices, or other vegetables
* Butter, softened
* Ketchup packets from the dining hall or any fast food restaurant

Instructions

1. Put your pan on the stove and turn it to low heat. Butter your bread.

2. Place the first slice in the pan.

3. Add your cheese, protein, and other add-ons. Top with the other slice of buttered bread. Cook until the first slice of bread is golden brown.

4. Then, flip the sandwich and continue to cook until the other slice is also golden brown and the cheese is melted. Remove from heat, cut diagonally — this is very important — and garnish with ketchup, if desired.

### Making some smoothie moves

While living in the dorms at Victoria College during my first year, for some reason, the only cooking instrument that I owned was a blender, so I probably drank 30 per cent of my meals.

My personal favourite variant of this next recipe is a triple berry smoothie, which involves using strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries as your frozen fruit with berry yogurt. 

I typically use milk in my smoothies, but water or any kind of juice will work — or a milk alternative if you have $5 to spend on almond milk. Instead of yogurt, you can also use ice cream — that way, you can feel healthy while basically drinking a milkshake. 

Ingredients

* 1 banana
* 1 1/2 cups of frozen fruit of your choice
* 3/4 cups of liquid — you can use less if you want a smoothie bowl
* 1/4 to 1/2 cup of yogurt or ice cream, or just one of those little yogurt cups
* A handful of spinach — I swear you won’t be able to taste it
* Chopped nuts, granola, fruit, coconut flakes, or other add-ons to top your smoothie

Instructions

1. Grab your frozen fruit and give it a rough chop to be kind to your blender.

2. Add the ingredients to your blender in order from hardest to softest. Start with your frozen fruit, and then add banana, spinach, yogurt, and your chosen liquid — add enough so that all of your fruit is submerged in it.

3. Blend and enjoy your quick and refreshing snack!

My first day of university consisted of a three-hour, C-level French lecture. Within seconds of entering the room — and hearing other students speak — it became blatantly obvious that my peers’ French comprehension was leagues above my own. The most flawless talent found in the class was that of my current best friend, Julia. 

Our friendship fully blossomed during an October thunderstorm. We’d splayed our study supplies across the hallways of UTSC, spending hours translating practice sentences over cartons of Chinese food. It was then that learned that Julia was vegan, as she’d bring her own food. 

These meals soon became my solace — the first time that I found a sense of belonging that year. Below is the recipe for one of my favourite meals from then. It’s my hope that, with it, you’ll find the comfort of a best friend, too.


Ingredients

* 1 package of chickpea spaghetti
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
* 1 carrot, thinly sliced
* 1 head of broccoli, cut into tiny pieces

Ingredients for the sauce

* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons coconut sugar
* 1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce — I sometimes substitute Sriracha
* 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

Instructions

1. Boil a large pot of water. Cook the spaghetti following package directions or until ready. Drain and rinse with cold water.

2. While the pasta cooks, heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium to high heat. Add the bell pepper and carrot. Cook for about three minutes. Add the broccoli, and cook for another two minutes until the broccoli turns bright green.

3. Whisk together all of the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

4. Add the cooked chickpea noodles and sauce mixture; fold gently to combine. Continue to cook for about three more minutes, or until the sauce is thickened and heated throughout.
