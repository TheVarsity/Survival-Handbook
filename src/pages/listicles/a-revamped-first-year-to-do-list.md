list:
  - title: Paint the UTSU dome
    text: From whimsical patterns to logos, the dome of the University of Toronto
      Students’ Union building has been sneakily painted and repainted by
      different student groups over the years, whether it’s to make a statement
      or celebrate an event.

      Wander through the Philosopher’s Walk
    text: "Need a break from the fast pace of downtown Toronto? Clear your mind and
      take a stroll through the Philosopher’s Walk, a scenic pathway located
      behind Trinity College. Ponder those deep questions — what is the meaning
      of life? Is our universe real? "
  - title: Find the secret UTM tunnel
    text: "Rumour has it there is an elusive passage winding underneath the UTM
      campus between the William G. Davis Building and Maanjiwe nendamowinan.
      Students have been attempting to find its location for years with little
      success. Discover the secret underground UTM tunnel and go down in history
      as a true blue legend. "
  - title: Go deer spotting at UTM
    text: "UTM doesn’t have a building called Deerfield Hall for nothing. Bambi and
      his friends can be found grazing around campus and plotting ways to
      surprise the next unsuspecting student. See if you can spot them before
      they spot you. "
  - title: Explore the art scene
    text: Toronto is celebrated for its vibrant and dynamic art scene. ARTSIDEOUT,
      held on the first Thursday of every October at the UTSC campus, is a
      daylong multidisciplinary arts festival. Due to the pandemic, it will be
      online this year. An app is currently in development, and performances and
      durational artwork will be shown on its website or on Instagram, in live
      or prerecorded formats. This year, artists are challenged to explore the
      theme of “Connections.” Fitting, no?
  - title: Shop local at the UTSC Farmers’ Market
    text: "Farmers, producers, and artisans from our local community have been
      coming together at the UTSC Farmers’ Market for 10 years. Adapting to
      COVID-19 measures, they are now open online and offer both delivery and
      curbside pickup options every Wednesday from 3:00–5:00 pm if ordered in
      advance. "
  - title: "Join a club or two "
    text: "U of T clubs have been hard at work over the summer to transition to an
      online platform to ensure accessibility for all those who are interested.
      Be sure to check them out on ULife and Facebook — with over 1,000 clubs
      and student-run organizations, you’re sure to find your niche! "
  - title: Take a side in the ultimate True Blue debate
    text: >
      If you haven’t met True Blue yet, you soon will. True Blue is our Varsity
      Blues mascot of dubious origins. Officially, True Blue is a navy-blue
      beaver — although this fact continues to be hotly debated, with many
      students claiming that True Blue is, in fact, a squirrel. 

      Fun fact: True Blue also has a sister, Blaze. To date, few have seen her.
